# AI Music Generation with LSTM

A deep learning project that generates classical music using LSTM neural networks trained on MIDI files from famous composers.

## ðŸŽµ Overview

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to train an LSTM model on classical music MIDI files, then generates new musical compositions in the style of composers like Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Schubert, Liszt, and Borodin.

## âœ¨ Features

- **MIDI Processing**: Extracts notes, chords, and rhythms from classical music files
- **LSTM Model**: Deep learning model trained on musical sequences
- **Music Generation**: Creates new musical compositions with controllable parameters
- **Sheet Music Visualization**: Displays generated music as musical notation
- **MIDI Export**: Saves generated music as playable MIDI files
